Recent technological advances are making it possible to build teams of
sensors and robots that can sense data from hard-to-reach places at
unprecedented spatio-temporal scales. Robotic sensing systems hold the
potential to revolutionize a diverse collection of applications such
as agriculture, environmental monitoring, climate studies, security
and surveillance in the near future. In order to make full use of this
technology, it is crucial to complement it with efficient algorithms
that plan for the sensing in these systems. In this dissertation, we
develop new sensor planning algorithms and present prototype robotic
sensing systems.

In the first part of this dissertation, we study two problems on
placing stationary sensors to cover an environment. Our objective is
to place the fewest number of sensors required to ensure that every
point in the environment is covered. In the first problem, we say a
point is covered if it is seen by sensors from all orientations. The
environment is represented as a polygon and the sensors are modeled as
omnidirectional cameras. Our formulation, which builds on the
well-known art gallery problem, is motivated by practical applications
such as visual inspection and video-conferencing where seeing objects
from all sides is crucial. In the second problem, we study how to
deploy bearing sensors in order to localize a target in the
environment. The sensors measure noisy bearings towards the target
which can be combined to localize the target. The uncertainty in
localization is a function of the placement of the sensors relative to
the target. For both problems we present (i) lower bounds on the
number of sensors required for an optimal algorithm, and (ii)
algorithms to place at most a constant times the optimal number of
sensors.

In the second part of this dissertation, we study motion planning
problems for mobile sensors. We start by investigating how to plan the
motion of a team of aerial robots tasked with tracking targets that
are moving on the ground. We then study various coverage problems that
arise in two environmental monitoring applications: using robotic
boats to monitor radio-tagged invasive fish in lakes, and using ground
and aerial robots for data collection in precision agriculture. We
formulate the coverage problems based on constraints observed in
practice. We also present the design of prototype robotic systems for
these applications. In the final problem, we investigate how to
optimize the low-level motion of the robots to minimize their energy
consumption and extend the system lifetime.

This dissertation makes progress towards building robotic sensing
systems along two directions. We present algorithms with strong
theoretical performance guarantees, often by proving our algorithms
are optimal or that their costs are at most a constant factor away from
the optimal values. We also demonstrate the feasibility and
applicability of our results through system implementation and with
results from simulations and extensive field experiments.
