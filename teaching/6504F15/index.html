	<h2 class="section">Description</h2>
	<p>
	This is an exciting time to be a roboticist. As technology improves rapidly, robots continue to smaller, faster, cheaper, and more sophisticated. It is becoming increasingly important to develop efficient decision-making algorithms that makes full use of the technology. The goal of this course is to get you to start thinking about developing algorithms for mobile robots. On successfully completing this course, you will be able to:
	<ul>
		<li>understand the fundamental problems in path planning, multi-robot coordination, sensor-based planning, and active perception;</li>
		<li>discuss and critique the state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques for solving the aforementioned problems;</li>
		<li>identify open research problems and initiate progress towards solving them;</li>
		<li>implement algorithms using open-source robotics tools (such as <a href="http://www.ros.org/">ROS</a>) and on actual ground/aerial robots.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
	This course is a seminar-style course featuring student-led discussions of recent research papers. See more information on paper presentations <a href="#presentations">here</a>. In order to make the course self-contained, I will give introductory lectures that cover background material.
	</p>

	<p>
	We will have assignments which will be a mix of theory questions, programming assignments, and at least one assignment on actual robots. You will also have to write reviews for papers covered in the class.
	</p>

	<p>
	The students will also work in groups on a research-oriented course project. More information about the project is <a href="#project">here</a>.

	<a id="textbook"></a> 
	<h2 class="section">Textbook</h2>
	<p>
	No required textbook. Course materials will be drawn from research papers and notes that I will post online.

	<h2 class="section">Schedule</h2>
	<p>
	A tentative schedule is given <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hhRAwzFhMDfJbBcZa9zWjmtiudq7b2ib5NeoUjWSQ3A/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

	<a id="assignments"></a> 
	<h2 class="section">Assignments</h2>
	<p>
	Details will posted on the class website soon. The assignments will be a mix of theory questions, MATLAB problems, and at least one implementation with a real robot.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="panel">
	<a id="presentations"></a> 
	<h2 class="section">Paper Presentations</h2>
	<p>
	Each student will present 2 or 3 papers of their choice during the semester. I will put up a list of papers for you to choose from. (A tentative list is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RZjYc6F45l9KhqpsIKGn38jp6j6CA99NeXGWc_oYHgA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.) You are also encouraged to search for papers on your own, preferably from a top robotics journals (<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8860">T-RO</a>, <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8856">T-ASE</a>, <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=100">RAM</a>, <a href="http://ijr.sagepub.com/">IJRR</a>, <a href="http://www.springer.com/engineering/robotics/journal/10514">AURO</a>) and conferences (<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome.jsp?punumber=1000639">ICRA</a>, <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome.jsp?punumber=1000393">IROS</a>, <a href="http://www.roboticsconference.org/">RSS</a>, <a href="http://www.wafr.org/">WAFR</a>). You may also present papers from related research areas (e.g., Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Controls, Computational Geometry) if they are relevant for the course. If so, please discuss with me if you have specific ideas. I will announce the mechanism for paper selection in the first two weeks of classes.
	</p2>

	<p>
	Each presentation must be at most 45 minutes long, plus time for discussions during and after the presentation. The nature of presentation --- powerpoint, whiteboard, interpretive dance --- is up to you. Depending on the paper, you may have to spend a significant portion of the time covering the background material. 
	</p>

	<p>
	One day (24 hours) before your scheduled presentation, you must post on the class forum a short summary (~400 words) in your own words of the paper you will be presenting. 
	</p>
</div>

<div class="panel">
	<a id="reviews"></a> 
	<h2 class="section">Paper Reviews</h2>
	<p>
	You will be asked to submit reviews (written individually) for two of the papers you presented in class and one paper that someone else presented. 
	</p>

	<p>
	Each review must contain: 
	<ol>
		<li>a concise, formal description of the problem addressed in the paper; </li>
		<li>a list of what you think are the main contributions of the paper over the state-of-the-art;</li> 
		<li>a list of shortcomings/weaknesses of the paper; and </li>
		<li>a list of open problems and possible future work related to the paper.</li>
	</ol>
	</p>

	<p>
	You may earn up to 10% bonus by doing extra work (per my discretion) related to the papers. For example, you can (i) implement the algorithms presented in the paper; or (ii) perform additional experiments to verify the results; or (iii) find a new way to derive or prove the results in the paper; or 
	(iv) solve one of the open problems in the paper.
	<p>
</div>

<div class="panel">
	<a id="project"></a> 
	<h2 class="section">Course Project</h2>
	<p>
	The project can be any of the following types:
	<ul>
		<li>Survey: An in-depth survey of a research area. The deliverable is a survey paper (between 8-10 pages).</li>
		<li>Theoretical: Work on formulating a new research problem and/or solving an existing problem. It is perfectly okay if you cannot solve the problem in its entirety during the class, however, you must demonstrate sufficient effort and progress. The deliverable is a project report (between 8-10 pages).</li>
		<li>Implementation: Implement an existing or new algorithm. This can be entirely in software or on hardware. The deliverable is a demo in the last week of classes and a report (6 pages). </li>
	</ul>
	All reports must follow the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/authors/authors_journals.html">IEEE Transactions</a> format.
	</p>

	<p>
	In addition to the above mentioned deliverables, each project team will give a presentation in the last week of the class. The size of the team will depend on the scope of the project.
	</p>

	<p>
	I will propose specific topics and hardware details in the first few lectures. You are also highly encouraged to choose a project topic that is related to your MS/PhD thesis research. However, your project topic must be relevant to this course, and must be performed during Fall â€˜15 semester. No double counting allowed. Discuss this with me, if you choose this route.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="panel">
	<a id="prereq"></a> 
	<h2 class="section">Prerequisites and Corequisites</h2>
	<p>
	There are no explicit prerequisites. This is an advanced, seminar-style course. Do not let that deter you. We will aim to keep the material self-contained and grounded in first principles. Feel free to discuss with me if you are unsure about your background.
	</p>

	<p>
	Some assignments will be MATLAB problems. <a href="http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/matlab/">Here</a> is one tutorial on MATLAB. You will find many more online. <a href="https://computing.ece.vt.edu/wiki/Matlab">Instructions</a> for installing and getting started with MATLAB.
