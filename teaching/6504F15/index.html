<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
These are exciting times to be a roboticist. We see new videos of robots performing impressive feats regularly. As the price-to-performance ratio of sensing, computation, and communication continues to fall, robots will continue to get more sophisticated. The goal of this course is to get you to be familiar with the state-of-the-art in robotics and start thinking about robotics research problems. 
</p>

On successfully completing the course, you will be able to:
<ul>
	<li>understand the fundamental research problems in path planning, multi-robot coordination, sensor-based planning, and active perception in robotics;</li>
	<li>discuss and critique the state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques for solving the aforementioned problems;</li>
	<li>identify open research problems and initiate progress towards solving them;</li>
	<li>implement algorithms using open-source robotics tools (such as <a href="http://www.ros.org/">ROS</a>) and on actual ground/aerial robots.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This course is a seminar-style course featuring student-led discussions of recent research papers. In order to make the course self-contained, I will give introductory lectures that cover foundational and background materials. These will be interspersed with student presentations. See more information on paper presentations here. 
</p>

<p>
We will have assignments which will be a mix of theory questions, programming assignments, and at least one assignment on actual robots. You will also have to write reviews for papers covered in the class.
</p>

<p>
The students will also work in groups on a research-oriented course project. More information about the project is here.
