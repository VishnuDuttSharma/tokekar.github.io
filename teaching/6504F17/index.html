	<h2 class="section">Description</h2>
	<p>
	This course will focus on the principles of decision-making in robotics. The <a href="http://tokekar.com/teaching/4984-5984S17/index.html">motion planning course</a> in Spring '17 focused on the problem of how to go from point A to point B. In this course, we will examine higher-level algorithms that make decisions as to what points A and B should be (for example) depending on the task at hand. Typical tasks that we will use as prototypical examples are where robots as mobile sensors. Specific research topics include:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Coverage</b>: distributed voronoi coverage (Lloyd's algorithm), Gaussian Process spatial and spatio-temporal map estimation
			<li><b>Route planning</b>: Traveling Salesperson Problem and Orienteering</li>
			<li><b>Information-theoretic path planning</b>: Adaptive sampling, Multi-armed bandit problems, Optimal stopping problems</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Submodular optimization, mutual information, entropy, Gaussian processes</li>
		</ul>
		<li><b>Adversarial planning</b>: Min-max games, Cooperative games, Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDPs)</li>
		<li><b>Misc</b>: Chance-constrained optimization, Reinforcement learning, Deep RL</li>
	</ul>
	
The first part of the course will consist of background lectures by the instructor. Most of the lectures will be based on foundational papers. This will be followed by an in-depth study of recent research papers which will be led by the students. The students will also work on a research-oriented course project. The goal of the course is to understand and critique research papers, identify open problems, and initiate progress towards solving them. An ideal outcome is for students to write a research paper at the end of the course.
	</p>

	<!--p>
	We will have regular assignments, a semester-long group project, and an individual term paper. The assignments will be a mix of writing and implementation exercises. You will also have to write <a href="#reviews">reviews</a> for papers covered in the class.
	</p-->

	<p>
	The students will also work in groups on a research-oriented course project. More information about the project is <a href="#project">here</a>.

	<a id="project"></a> 
	<h2 class="section">Course Project</h2>

	<p>
	The project can be any of the following types:
	<ul>
		<li>Survey: An in-depth survey of a research area. The deliverable is a survey paper (between 8-10 pages).</li>
		<li>Theoretical: Work on formulating a new research problem and/or solving an existing problem. It is perfectly okay if you cannot solve the problem in its entirety during the class, however, you must demonstrate sufficient effort and progress. The deliverable is a project report (between 8-10 pages).</li>
		<li>Implementation: Implement an existing or new algorithm. This can be entirely in software or on hardware. The deliverable is a demo in the last week of classes and a report (6 pages). </li>
	</ul>
	All reports must follow the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/authors/authors_journals.html">IEEE Transactions</a> format.

	<p>
	You will be asked to submit <b>tbd</b> reviews, written individually, for tbd% each. Each review must contain: 
	<ol>
		<li>a concise, formal description of the problem addressed in the paper; </li>
		<li>a list of what you think are the main contributions of the paper over the state-of-the-art;</li> 
		<li>a list of shortcomings/weaknesses of the paper; and </li>
		<li>a list of open problems and possible future work related to the paper.</li>

	<a id="prereq"></a> 
	<h2 class="section">Prerequisites</h2>
	<p>
	This is a seminar-style course that will feature a discussion of research papers. An ability to read and critique research papers is required. 
	</p>

	<p>
	There are no explicit prerequisites. <font color="red">However, students should be very comfortable in at least two of the following areas: <a href="http://tokekar.com/teaching/4984-5984S17/index.html">Robot Motion Planning (ECE 4984)</a>; Data Structures and Algorithms (ECE 2574); Probability, Filtering, and Estimation (ECE 5605/5606); Computer Vision (ECE 5554); Machine Learning/AI (ECE 4424/4524/5424). </font>
	</p>

	<p>
	Prior background in robotics is helpful, but not required.

	<h2 class="section">Academic Integrity</h2>
	
	<p>
	You are encouraged to discuss the course materials with the instructor and other students in the class. However, any work that you submit (including but not limited to homeworks, paper reviews, project reports) must be your own. <b>Give proper citations if you use any code or data from anyone else</b>. 
	</p>

	<p>The Undergraduate Honor Code pledge that each member of the university community agrees to abide by states:	<i>“As a Hokie, I will conduct myself with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do.”</i></p>

	<p>
	Students enrolled in this course are responsible for abiding by the Honor Code. A student who has doubts about how the Honor Code applies to any assignment is responsible for obtaining specific guidance from the course instructor before submitting the assignment for evaluation. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the University community from the requirements and expectations of the Honor Code.

	The tenets of the Virginia Tech Graduate Honor Code will be strictly enforced in this course, and all assignments shall be subject to the stipulations of the Graduate Honor Code.
