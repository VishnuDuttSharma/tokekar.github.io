	<h2 class="section">Description</h2>
	<p>
	This course will cover fundamental and state-of-the-art research topics in decision making for robotics. The first part of the course will consist of background lectures by the instructor. This will be followed by an in-depth study of recent research papers which will be led by the students. The students will also work on a research-oriented course project. The goal of the course is to understand and critique research papers, identify open problems, and initiate progress towards solving them. 
	</p>

	<p>Topics include:
	<ul>
		<li>Combinatorial planning: Traveling Salesperson Problem and Orienteering</li>
		<li>Submodular optimization, mutual information, entropy, Gaussian processes</li>
		<li>Information-theoretic path planning: Adaptive sampling, Multi-armed bandit problems, Optimal stopping problems</li>
		<li>Adversarial planning: Min-max games, Cooperative games, Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDPs)</li>
		<li>Reinforcement learning</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	This course is a seminar-style course featuring student-led discussions of recent research papers. See more information on paper presentations <a href="#presentations">here</a>. In order to make the course self-contained, I will give introductory lectures that cover background material.
	</p>

	<p>
	We will have weekly assignments, a semester-long group project, and an individual term paper. The assignments will be a mix of writing and implementation exercises. You will also have to write <a href="#reviews">reviews</a> for papers covered in the class.
	</p>

	<p>
	The students will also work in groups on a research-oriented course project. More information about the project is <a href="#project">here</a>.

	<p>
	Each student will lead the discussion on tbd papers choice during the semester. You may choose a paper from the list given <a href="">here</a>.
	</p>
	
	<!--p>
	You are also encouraged to search for papers on your own, preferably from a top robotics journals (<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8860">T-RO</a>, <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8856">T-ASE</a>, <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=100">RAM</a>, <a href="http://ijr.sagepub.com/">IJRR</a>, <a href="http://www.springer.com/engineering/robotics/journal/10514">AURO</a>) and conferences (<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome.jsp?punumber=1000639">ICRA</a>, <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome.jsp?punumber=1000393">IROS</a>, <a href="http://www.roboticsconference.org/">RSS</a>, <a href="http://www.wafr.org/">WAFR</a>). You may also present papers from related research areas (e.g., Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Controls, Computational Geometry) if they are relevant for the course. If so, please discuss with me if you have specific ideas. I will announce the mechanism for paper selection in the first two weeks of classes.
	</p2-->

	<!--p>
	Each presentation must be at most 45 minutes long, plus time for discussions during and after the presentation. The nature of presentation --- powerpoint, whiteboard, interpretive dance --- is up to you. Depending on the paper, you may have to spend a significant portion of the time covering the background material. 
	</p-->

	<!--p>
	One day (24 hours) before your scheduled presentation, you must post on the class forum a short summary (~400 words) in your own words of the paper you will be presenting. 
	</p-->

	<a id="project"></a> 
	<h2 class="section">Course Project</h2>

	<p>
	The project can be any of the following types:
	<ul>
		<li>Survey: An in-depth survey of a research area. The deliverable is a survey paper (between 8-10 pages).</li>
		<li>Theoretical: Work on formulating a new research problem and/or solving an existing problem. It is perfectly okay if you cannot solve the problem in its entirety during the class, however, you must demonstrate sufficient effort and progress. The deliverable is a project report (between 8-10 pages).</li>
		<li>Implementation: Implement an existing or new algorithm. This can be entirely in software or on hardware. The deliverable is a demo in the last week of classes and a report (6 pages). </li>
	</ul>
	All reports must follow the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/authors/authors_journals.html">IEEE Transactions</a> format.
	</p>

	<a id="reviews"></a> 
	<h2 class="section">Paper Reviews</h2>
	<p>
	You will be asked to submit <b>tbd</b> reviews, written individually, for tbd% each. Each review must contain: 
	<ol>
		<li>a concise, formal description of the problem addressed in the paper; </li>
		<li>a list of what you think are the main contributions of the paper over the state-of-the-art;</li> 
		<li>a list of shortcomings/weaknesses of the paper; and </li>
		<li>a list of open problems and possible future work related to the paper.</li>
	</ol>

	This is a seminar-style course that will feature a discussion of research papers. An ability to read and critique research papers is required. 
	</p>

	<p>
	There are no explicit prerequisites. <font color="red">However, students should be very comfortable in at least two of the following areas: <a href="http://tokekar.com/teaching/4984-5984S17/index.html">Robot Motion Planning (ECE 4984)</a>; Data Structures and Algorithms (ECE 2574); Probability, Filtering, and Estimation (ECE 5605/5606); Computer Vision (ECE 5554); Machine Learning/AI (ECE 4424/4524/5424). </font>
	</p>

	<p>
	Prior background in robotics is helpful, but not required. We will aim to keep the material self-contained. I will cover the relevant background materials in lectures. 
	</p>

<div class="panel">
	<h2 class="section">Academic Integrity</h2>
	
	<p>
	You are encouraged to discuss the course materials with the instructor and other students in the class. However, any work that you submit (including but not limited to homeworks, paper reviews, project reports) must be your own. <b>Give proper citations if you use any code or data from anyone else</b>. 
	</p>

	<p>The Undergraduate Honor Code pledge that each member of the university community agrees to abide by states:	<i>“As a Hokie, I will conduct myself with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do.”</i></p>

	<p>
	Students enrolled in this course are responsible for abiding by the Honor Code. A student who has doubts about how the Honor Code applies to any assignment is responsible for obtaining specific guidance from the course instructor before submitting the assignment for evaluation. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the University community from the requirements and expectations of the Honor Code. For additional information about the Honor Code, please visit: <a href="http://www.honorsystem.vt.edu">www.honorsystem.vt.edu</a>.</p>
