	<h2 class="section">Description</h2>
	<p>
	This course will focus on the principles of decision-making in robotics. <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2019/cmsc818N/">Motion planning </a> focuses on the problem of <i>how</i> to go from point A to point B. In this course, we will examine higher-level algorithms that <i>make decisions</i> as to what points A and B should be depending on the task at hand. In standard motion planning, the goal location is given as input. In constrast, in the decision-making problems we will consider in this course, the goal locations(s) will be the output. In fact, most scenarios we will study require making sequential decisions where the output is a series of goal location(s) (or actions or tasks and so on) and where decisions we make in the past may influence the options available at a future instance.</p>

<p>Most of the lectures will be based on research papers and discussion of open research problems. The students will also work on a research-oriented course project. The goal of the course is to understand, critique, and implement research papers, identify open problems, and make progress towards solving them. An ideal outcome is for students to write a research paper at the end of the course.
	</p>

	<p>The lectures will be conducted on Zoom. We will have a mix of traditional lectures conducted by the instructor synchronously over Zoom. The lectures will be recorded and posted on ELMS. However, a significant portion of the course will revolve around discussion of recent research papers (led by the students). Some of the discussion will happen asynchronously via Piazza and some live during lectures. We are also planning to have guest lectures from academia and industry and try some atypical lecture formats (stay tuned for more).

	<a id="textbook"></a>
	<h2 class="section">Textbook</h2>
	<p>
	No required textbook. Course materials will be drawn from research papers and notes that will be posted online.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="panel">
	<a id="schedule"></a>
	<h2 class="section">Schedule</h2>
	Will be posted shortly. Topics that will be covered include (but are not limited to): <i>Markov Decision Processes; Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes; Monte-Carlo Tree Search; Deep reinforcement learning; Proximal Policy Optimization; Graph Neural Networks; Multi-Robot Task Assignment and Matching; Information-Theoretic Path Planning (mutual information, entropy, submodularity); Active Perception.</i>

	<a id="grading"></a>
	<h2 class="section">Grading</h2>
	<p>This is still tentative and subject to change. Evaluation will be composed of the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Exam (30%)</li>
		<li>Research Project (25%)</li>
		<li>Mini-projects (20%)</li>
		<li>Assignments (10%)</li>
		<li>Presentation (10%)</li>
		<li>Class participation (5%)</li>
	</ul>
	Details of each are given below.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="panel">
	<a id="exam"></a>
	<h2 class="section">Exam</h2>

	<p>
	This will be in the style of a take-home exam. You will be given 1-2 days (subject to change) to solve the exam and upload your solutions. The exam will likely be in November.
</p>

<div class="panel">
	<a id="project"></a>
	<h2 class="section">Research Project</h2>

	<p>
	This is a research-oriented course. An ideal outcome of this course is a research paper that can be submitted to a top-tier robotics venue. During the course, each student is expected to identify a research question and make progress towards solving it. The course project will be the medium through which we will facilitate that.  It is perfectly okay if you cannot solve the problem in its entirety during the class, however, you must demonstrate sufficient effort and progress.
</p>

<p>
	The project can be done in groups of up to four students. Students are encouraged to work on a project that connects the material covered in this course with their existing research.
</p>

	<p>There will be several milestones during the course which will all count towards the points reserved for the project.
		<ul>
			<li>Pitch: Students will record and post a short narrated, presentation describing their initial ideas. We will use this to form project groups as well as get feedback from your peers.</li>
			<li>Proposal: After the pitch, students will submit a short two page extended abstract describing the proposed research project. This report will be an Overleaf document that will be updated throughout the semester and evolve into the final project report.</li>
			<li>Updates: We will have several check-ins throughout the semester. These will be during office hours with the TA and instructor, during lectures, as well as a short narrated, presentation that will be posted for the rest of the class and peer-reviewed.</li>
			<li>Presentation: At the end of the course, we will have a virtual poster presentation where teams will present the final results. We may have guest judges to award prizes for the best posters/projects.</li>
			<li>Report: The final report must be in the style of a conference paper.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

<div class="panel">
	<a id="miniproj"></a>
	<h2 class="section">Mini-Projects</h2>
	<p>
		There will be two mini-projects. You are expected to work on these for roughly 4 weeks each. The mini-projects must be done in groups of  2 students.
		<ul>
			<li>Create a tutorial on a topic <i>related</i> to decision-making for robotics that will not be directly covered in class (due end of September). Ideally, these are topics that are useful in robot decision-making AND one that you are familiar with from a previous class. Example topics will be posted shortly. The tutorial must be in the style of a blogpost or a Wikipedia article and will be linked on the class webpage.</li>
			<li>Implement algorithm(s) from a research paper that we discuss in class or one of your choice after approval from the instructor (due end of October). The goal of this mini-project could to be (a) reproduce the results in the paper; (b) evaluate the algorithms to a new dataset; or (c) implement the algorithms in the paper in a novel setting. In all cases, the emphasis will be on discussing the results and the challenges associated with reproducibility.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

<div class="panel">
	<a id="assignments"></a>
	<h2 class="section">Assignments</h2>
	<p>
		The assignments will be a mix of hands-on implementation exercises as well theory questions. We will have 3-4 assignments and typically due within 10 days of posting.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="panel">
	<a id="presentations"></a>
	<h2 class="section">Paper Presentations</h2>
	<p>
	Each student will lead the discussion on research papers during the semester. You may choose a paper from the list given <a href="">here</a>.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="panel">
	<a id="participation"></a>
	<h2 class="section">Class Participation</h2>
	<p>
	While the lectures will be conducted synchronously, the participation points are reserved only for the asynchronous component. These points will be awarded for being active in the class discussion forum (Piazza), scribing lecture notes, and peer review of project proposals and mini-projects.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="panel">
	<a id="prereq"></a>
	<h2 class="section">Prerequisites</h2>
	<p>
	This is a seminar-style course that will feature a discussion of research papers. An ability to read and critique research papers is required.
	</p>

	<p>
	There are no explicit prerequisites. <font color="red">However, students should be very comfortable in at least two of the following areas: Probability and Bayesian Statistics; Algorithms; Machine Learning/AI; Optimization.</font>
	</p>

	<p>
	We will mostly use Python for implementation. Some level of comfort using Python would be good but is not a requirement. It is expected that you will be able to pick up the basics needed for the assignments.
	</p>

	<p>
	Prior background in robotics is helpful, but not required.
	</p>

<div class="panel">
	<h2 class="section">Academic Integrity</h2>

	<p>
	You are encouraged to discuss the course materials with the instructor and other students in the class. However, any work that you submit (including but not limited to homeworks, paper reviews, project reports) must be your own. <b>Give proper citations if you use any code or data from anyone else</b>.
	</p>

<div class="panel">
	<h2 class="section">Services for Students with Disabilities</h2>
	<p>
	Any student who feels that he or she may need an accommodation because of a disability (learning disability, attention deficit disorder, psychological, physical, etc.), please make an appointment to see me during office hours.
