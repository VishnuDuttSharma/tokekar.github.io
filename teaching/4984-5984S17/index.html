	<h2 class="section">Description</h2>
	<p>
	This is an exciting time to be a roboticist. Robots continue to get smaller, faster, and cheaper. Robots today are packed with sophisticated computing, communication, and sensing resources. It is becoming increasingly important to develop efficient motion planning algorithms that makes full use of the robot's capabilities. In this course, we will discuss the state-of-the-art algorithms that aim to do just that.
	</p>

	<p>The course will be a mix of theoretical and applied subject matter where the students will learn the fundamental planning concepts and apply them through programming assignments and class projects. We will cover discrete and sample-based, higher-level planning algorithms for mobile (ground and aerial) robots operating in 3D space. The course will also focus on perception issues in the context of planning.</p>

	<p>Topics include:
	<ul>
		<li>Shortest path planning on graphs (A*, depth-first search)</li>
		<li>Shortest path planning in polygonal environments (visibility-based roadmaps)	
		<li>Sampling-based planning in complex environments</li>
		<li>Vision-based navigation</li>
		<li>Dynamic obstacle avoidance</li>
		<li>Planning under perception and action uncertainty (Markov Decision Processes)</li>
		<li>Reinforcement learning</li>
		<li>Multi-robot coordination (graph matching and assignment)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>We will have (almost) weekly assignments, a semester-long group project, and an individual term paper. The assignments will be a mix of writing and implementation exercises. We will extensively use <a href="http://www.ros.org/">ROS</a> for the implementions in <a href="http://gazebosim.org/">simulation</a> and on actual robots. You should be familiar with programming in either Python or C/C++ and comfortable with Linux.</p>

	<p>
	You are encouraged to discuss the course materials with the instructor and other students in the class. However, any work that you submit (including but not limited to homeworks, paper reviews, project reports) must be your own. <b>Give proper citations if you use any code or data from anyone else</b>. 
	</p>
